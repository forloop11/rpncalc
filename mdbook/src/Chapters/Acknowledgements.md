# Acknowledgments

This is a simple user guide for a tiny piece of software.  But I have used other people's art and applications to create RPNCalc and I want to ensure I recognize them and give them thanks.

## Graphics

I'd like to thank FlatIcon.com for their non-commercial use license for the top right icons used in this guide as well as IconFinder.

Simply add the value of the requested constant to the top of the stack / line1

|Constant|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|pi| Archimedes' constant, or PI, is the name given to the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter. `PI` inserts the value of [PI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) onto the stack.  Pi is approximately `3.14159265359`|
|phi| Insert [PHI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio), also known as the Golden Ratio, to the stack.  Phi is approximately `1.618033989`|
|euler| Euler's number is also known as the exponential growth constant. It is the base for natural logarithms and is found in many areas of mathematics. The command `euler` inserts [Euler's number (e)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) onto the stack.  e is approximately `2.7182818284590`|
|sol|Inserts the speed of light onto the stack in meters/second.  **c = 299,792,458 m/s**|

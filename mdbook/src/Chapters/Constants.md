# Constants

These commands simply take a defined constant and add that number to the top of the stack (`line1`).  There are currently not that many constants defined, but if there is a desire to add additional ones please me know.  It's quick and easy.

To use a constant, simply run the command and the value of the requested constant will be added to the top of the stack / `line1`

|Constant| Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|pi| **PI - ARCHIMEDES' CONSTANT**<br>[Archimedes' constant, or PI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi), is the name given to the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter. `PI` inserts the value of PI onto the stack.  In RPNCalc, Pi is calculated to 50 decimal places `3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510` |
|phi| **PHI - THE GOLDEN RATIO**<br>If the stack is empty, `phi` will simply insert the [PHI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio), also known as the Golden Ratio, onto the top of the stack (`line1`). In RPNCalc, Phi is defined as `1.618033989`<br>However, if there is an item on the stack, it will also display the possible long and short section values |
|euler| **EULER'S NUMBER**<br>Euler's number is also known as the exponential growth constant. It is the base for natural logarithms and is found in many areas of mathematics. The command `euler` inserts [Euler's number (e)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)) onto the stack.  e is approximately `2.71828182845` |
|sol| **SPEED OF LIGHT**<br>Inserts the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light), in meters per second, onto the stack. RPNCalc uses `299,792,458 m/s` as the speed of light|

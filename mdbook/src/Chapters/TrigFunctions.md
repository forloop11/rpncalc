# Trigonometry Functions

RPNCalc does not consider itself a scientific calculator (at least not currently).  However, it's certainly beyond a very basic calculator.  The trigonometry commands listed here are very basic, but do fill a need if you need to do a few basic calculations.  

Lastly, I'm happy to add more capabilities if there is a desire (and an offer to help test).

|sin [rad]<br>cos [rad]<br>tan [rad]|Calculate the [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry) function requested.  Angles are input as degrees by default unless the optional `rad` parameter is given in which case the angles will be in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian).<br><br>**Example:** `tan` will calculate the tangent using `line1` as the angle in degrees.  Use `tan rad` if `line1` contains the angle in radians|
|asin [rad]<br>acos [rad]<br>atan [rad]|Calculate the arc [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry) function.  Like the above, the result is returned in degrees unless `rad` parameter is provided|
|hypot<br>hypotenuse| Assumes the top two stack items are the right triangle' legs and this function returns the hypotenuse using the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem).  Specifically, it returns SQRT( (`line1`^2 + `line2`^2 ))|

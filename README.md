# INTRODUCTION
<img align="right" width="50%" src="https://github.com/frossm/rpncalc/raw/master/graphics/ScreenShot.jpg">RPNCalc is the command-line based Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator.  RPN calculators make it very simple to do complex calculations, especially if there are parentheses involved.

I've created a [User Guide](https://frossm.github.io/RPNCalc-UserGuide) to do a better job of explaining how to use RPNCalc than the old readme.md file, which was getting really long.  If you have questions, issues, feedback, or ideas, please let me know.  You can contact me via the links in the **Introduction** page of the User Guide.

# INTRODUCTION

RPNCalc is the command-line based Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator.  RPN calculators make it very simple to do complex calculations, especially if there are parentheses involved.

I've created a detailed [User Guide](https://frossm.github.io/RPNCalc-UserGuide) to do a better job of explaining how to use RPNCalc.  It's not hard, but there are quite a few advanced capabilities that require explanation.  The old readme.md file was getting long and hard to manage.

If you have questions, issues, feedback, or ideas, please let me know.  You can contact me via the links in the **Introduction** page of the User Guide.

# INTRODUCTION

RPNCalc is the command-line based Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator.  RPN calculators make it very simple to do complex calculations, especially if there are parentheses involved.

I've created a detailed [User Guide](https://frossm.github.io/RPNCalc-UserGuide) to do a better job of explaining how to use RPNCalc. If you have questions, issues, feedback, or ideas, please let me know.  You can contact me via the links in the **Introduction** page of the User Guide.

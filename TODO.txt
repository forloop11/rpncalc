-- COMPLETE --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logging:
 - [COMPLETE 1.2.2] Change wording of log file entry for "flipping sign"
 - [COMPLETE 1.2.2] Put new number in stack and flip or sign change
 - [COMPLETE 1.2.2] Don't log MoneyMode.  It's only a display item.
 - [COMPLETE 1.2.4] Make log nicer.  Show results of operands.  LIttle total lines, etc.

Command Line Options
 - [COMPLETE 1.2.2] Get rid of -c as it's kinda useless.  Just clear stack before you exit with -p on.

Bugs:
 - [COMPLETE 1.2.9] Allow a space before the operand during an numop command.  Ex:  "443 *" should work.
